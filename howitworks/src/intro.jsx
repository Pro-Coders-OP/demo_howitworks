              According to a report from Indiatoday.in, India leads the world in teenage depression.One in 4 teenagers in India suffers from depression.
              We saw this and while we couldn't treat them clinically, we can help them in coping up from this.
              Let's face it, we all are music lovers. 
              We wanted to know the general mental state of people in various age groups. Also their taste in music. We wanted to create a service which services our users from various age groups.
              So we came up with a combined solution and we did it. 
              Our project recommends users an appropiate playlist based upon their current mood.

              First, we collect Sign n Login data from user.
              This data gets entered in signup n login table simultaneously
              and gets saved on a created Node server 
              For security purposes, password hashing is done and thus are encrypted.
              When logged in, a page displays webcam. 
              The current expression of user's face is captured and recognised
              This works by capturing the image and passing the image to our ML algorithm powered by CNN(Convolutional neural network).
              This expression is passed to survey table along with the user's basic details.
               User is then redirected to homepage.
              User gets various options displayed to navigate.
              When the user opts to listen some music, we recommend him a music playlist based on his recently recognised mood.
              If a user opts to view our survey, our real-time updating survey gets displayed.
              The survey is all about the general mental state of people of various age groups
              Additionally, it also displays people's taste of music in various age groups.
              This information is presented using visually appealing elements.
              User may also see our "How it works" page which contains every bit of information needed to create a project liks ours'.
              At last, an "About Us" page is also present providing info about the brains behind this project.
